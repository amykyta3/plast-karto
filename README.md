# Plast Maps
This repository is the project home for maps of Пластові Оселі in the US.


## Download latest maps
Check back later. They are not ready yet.


## How can I contribute?

Check out the issues page. If something is [marked as "Help Wanted"](https://github.com/amykyta3/plast-maps/labels/Help%20Wanted),
it means I could use your help!

### Field Surveys
The biggest thing I need help with is collecting survey data. If you have a
handheld GPS, notebook, and love exploring our amazing Пластові оселі, you can help!

Check out any [issues marked as "Survey Needed"](https://github.com/amykyta3/plast-maps/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Survey+Needed%22) for
details on what needs to be done.

Here are [some tips on how to do an effective field survey](https://github.com/amykyta3/plast-maps/wiki/How-to-survey-using-GPS).

### Report inaccuracies
Is a map out of date because there is a new road or building?
Is a trail overgrown and doesn't really exist anymore?
Let me know by creating [an issue ticket](https://github.com/amykyta3/plast-maps/issues)
(or just email me).


## Old Maps
Until the next generation of maps are ready, the old ones I created for
Вовча Тропа and Писаний Камінь can be found in the [archive folder](archive).
